Like all good serial killers Rob was a quiet child. 

Growing up in Moston, North Manchester he learned to be as hard as nails from birth. As an infant he threw himself head first into a red hot pan of stew by the fire. Not for any reason in particular, it was just a kind of dare to himself. He spent his time in intensive care pinching nurses arses, drinking Guinness and smoking Marlboro red. Later in life he would look back at his time in Booth hall childrenâ€™s hospital as probably the best time of his life.
